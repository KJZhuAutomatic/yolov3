	adventage:
		can gain the width and depth of layers
		print the archieve as
4.check_anchor_order, initialize_weight, initialize_biases may be important
5.print info of model layers, num_params and FLOPs

tips:
	attribute of Path(f): suffix, parent(s), resolve, stem
	
	when run as entrance, such as python path/to/file
		__name__ == '__main__', __file__ == path/to/file
	when import as a module
		__name__ == 'pkg.[subpkg.]module', __file__ == global path of path/to/file 


check_file in utils.general:
